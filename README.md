## Overview
This project comprises an experimental environment to study the impact of gender stereotype threat on student anxiety. In summary, the application has the following workflow:
1. Consent form
2. Pre-test (anxiety assessment)
3. Gamified activity. There are three different design flavours for this activity: male-stereotyped, female-stereotyped, and neutral. Upon finishing the pre-test, one of the three flavours is randomly selected for the current participant. Please note the activity content does not change across versions (only UI elements like colours and images).
4. Post-test (anxiety assessment, same as the pre-test).


## Getting started

In order to setup this project for a real use in your research, you will need to follow two basic steps: (1) adapt the project for your research needs; and (2) actual run the project. If you just want to see how it looks like, you can go straight to step 2 and run the project locally.  

### Step 1: Adapting the project for your needs

* In general, most textual content can be changed by editing the '*.html' files located in:
	* `webapp/views/`
* To change the anxiety questions, refer to:
	* `webapp/scripts/controllers/PretestCtrl.js`
	* `webapp/scripts/controllers/PosttestCtrl.js`
* For server configurations, refer to:
	* `Server.js`
	* The server listens to `localhost` at port `8080` by default
* To change the endpoint URL to where the responses are submitted, refer to:
	* `webapp/scripts/services.js`


### Step 3: Running the project
A simple way to run this project is:

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
2. Go to the project directory
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
3. Run the project:
```
npm start
```

## Guide

### Changing the questions
In the folder `/webapp/scripts/controllers/` there are two files called `PretestCtrl.js` and `PosttestCtrl.js`. The process is identical in both.

1. Open the file with a text editor.
2. Search for `$scope.questions`
3. This line contains an array with all questions.
 + The questions must be between quotation marks, separated by commas and within the same block delimited by square brackets. E.g:
```javascript
$scope.questions = ["Do you like apples?", "And pineapples?", "...even on pizza?"]
```
5. Change the number of questions in ``$scope.processAnswers``

### Adding questionaries
1. Open ``/webapp/views/``, copy the file `posttest.html` and paste it in the same folder, and rename it. (e.g, 'questionary2.html')
 + You can also open it with a text editor to modify the textual content of the page.
2. Open ``/webapp/scripts/controllers`` and create a file called ``ThenameyouchoseCtrl.js`` (e.g 'Questionary2Ctrl.js').
 + The file must follow this template:

```javascript
// In the following line, 'Questionary2Ctrl' is the name I chose for the controller. It will be important later.
angular.module('tutor').controller("Questionary2Ctrl", function($scope, $location, User) {
	$scope.questions = ["How much do you like apples?", "And pineapples?", "...even on pizza?"] // Array of questions. See the guide above
	$scope.answers = [];

	$scope.processAnswers = function() {
		if ($scope.answers.length < $scope.questions.length) {
			$scope.msg = "Please answer all questions!";
		} else {
			var ans = $scope.answers;

			// Invert positive answers
			// ans[0] = 5 - ans[0]; 	// uncomment to invert the first answer
			// ans[1] = 5 - ans[1]; 	// uncomment to invert the second answer
			// ans[5] = 5 - ans[5]; 	// uncomment to invert the sixth answer

			var sum = ans.reduce(add, 0);

			function add(a, b) {
				return parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
			}

			var resp = User.getResponse();

			// Keep these if the questionary is part of the pre-test
			User.setPre(resp.pre.concat(ans)); // Save the answers
			User.setPretestPoints(resp.pretestPoints + sum); // Save the points

			// Keep these if the questionary is part of the post-test
			User.setPost(resp.post.concat(ans)); // Save the answers
			User.setPosttestPoints(resp.posttestPoints + sum); // Save the points
			// User.save(); // Submit participant's response to server; Used at the very end of the survey

			$location.path("/home"); // Change it to the page you want the user to be redirected to
		}
	};
});
```

3. Open ``webapp/index.html`` with a text editor and add this inside the ``<body>`` tag:
```html
<script src="scripts/controllers/Questionary2Ctrl.js"></script>
```
+ Remember to change 'Questionary2Ctrl' to the name of the file you created in the previous step.

4. Open ``webapp/scripts/app.js`` with a text editor, search for ``routeProvider.when`` and add this in the line immediately above it:
```javascript
$routeProvider.
    when("/questionary2", { // Path
        templateUrl: "views/questionary2.html", // Path to the file you created in step 1
        controller: "Questionary2Ctrl" // Name of the controller you created in step 2
	});
```

5. Find the controller of the page you want to precede the page you just created at ``/webapp/scripts/controllers`` and change its ``$location.path`` to the path you chose in the previous step.
